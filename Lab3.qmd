| -   **trial_type** - Trial type (lullaby vs.Â non-lullaby). They also had "preference" trials in the experiment. Those trials are not included in this dataset.                                                                                                                          |

| -   **obs_num** - For each trial, they measured heart rate roughly every .4 seconds. This variable tells you which observation in a trial you're looking at (.4 seconds after the trial started would be coded as `1`, .8 seconds after the trial started would be coded as `2`, etc.). |

1.  Let's start by trying to understand the structure of the dataset. Calculate the following:\

    -   The age of the youngest (minimum) child in the dataset.\
    -   The age of the oldest (maximum) child in the dataset.\
    -   The total number of observations represented in the data.

2.  Create a data frame with only the first observation from the first trial for each participant. Uses this data frame to answer the following questions:\

    -   How many participants are present in the dataset?\

    -   How many 7-month-olds are there?\

    -   Arrange the data frame from youngest to oldest. What's the participant_id for the youngest infant?\

    -   Arrange the data frame from oldest to youngest. What's the participant_id for the oldest infant?

3.  What is the mean number of observations per individual trial? (hint: you'll need to use both `group_by` and `ungroup`).

4.  How many observations are there in the lullaby condition and the non-lullaby condition?

5.  Next, let's examine the dependent variable, heart rate. Create a new variable called `hr_round` that is the heart rate value rounded to the nearest hundredth (use the function `round()`).

6.  Plot a histogram of `hr_round`. Be sure to add appropriate labels and a title to your plot. What distribution would you say this looks like?

7.  The histogram generated from the `bb2021` data for the `hr_round` variable appears to be normal distributed. Let's perform bootstrapping on this dataset 10,000 times and examine the resulting histogram.

    Firstly, extract only the `hr_round` variable from the `bb2021` data. Following this, use the `rep_sample_n` function from the `moderndive` package (ensure it is installed) to bootstrap the dataset. If you are unfamiliar with this function, it allows for easy bootstrapping without the need to write loops. Set the function to randomly sample 100 rows (size = 100) and repeat this process 10,000 times (reps=10000). This will result in a large data frame.

    Upon completion, plot the histogram for all the bootstrapped values. How does it compare to the original?

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    library(moderndive) #get rep_sample_n func
    samples <- _____  %>% 
      ____  %>%
      rep_sample_n(size =_ , reps =_ , replace=TRUE) 
    ```

8.  Create a density plot of `hr_round.`

9.  Calculate the mean heart rate for each participant on each trial type. Save it to a new data frame called `participant_means`.

10. Use `participant_means` to create a violin plot showing the distribution of heart rates in the lullaby and non-lullaby conditions. Your plot should be a simplified version of Figure 2a in the paper with (a) two violins, (b) each violin a different color, and (c) points showing the underlying data. Get rid of the legend.

    ::: callout-tip
    The order that you add geoms to your plot matters here. It did not matter for simple class experiment.
    :::

11. Pick a new theme for your figure. Also, add two different colors to it.

12. Now make a rain cloud plot of the figure. Look at vignette here for an idea how to create them using `geom_rain`: https://www.njudd.com/raincloud-ggrain/

13. Use `participant_means` and plot the data with a strip chart. Use `stat_summary` to plot the mean for each condition.

    ::: callout-tip
    `- position = position_jitter` controls how far apart points are.
    :::

14. Create the plot below showing the mean heart rate by condition across trials. Next, change the point size such that it corresponds to the number of trials represented.

15. Make a beautiful, clear plot that answers a question you might be interested in from the paper. *Make sure to include a descriptive title and it is publication ready.*
